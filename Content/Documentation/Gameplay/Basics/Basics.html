    Combat Basics<br />
    <br />
    Controls<br />
    AHFG can be controlled with two input methods: keyboard or mouse.<br />
    <br />
    <em>Note that the keybinds listed are the defaults and can be changed if you so wish</em><br />
    Basic actions<br />
    <br />
    Moving: To walk/run left or right, use the A and D keys on keyboard and tilt the left control stick on gamepad.<br />
    <br />
    Jumping: To jump, press W on keyboard or the bottom circular button on gamepad.<br />
    You can press the jump button again to double jump, and you can influence the direction you fall by pressing left or right.<br />
    <br />
    Normal Attack: On keyboard, use the P key to use a normal attack or the right circular button on gamepad.<br />
    You can use different attacks called "tilt attacks" by pressing the normal attack button while holding a direction.<br />
    <br />
    Aerial Attack: If you press the attack button while airborne, you will use an aerial attack. Aerial attacks can be directional too!<br />
    <br />
    Finisher Attack: If you double tap a direction or flick the control stick very hard and then press the attack button, you will use a very powerful finisher move.<br />
    If your timing is off, it may not work - try to attack slightly after you hit the direction!<br />
    <br />
    Special Attack: On keyboard, use the O key to use a special attack or the left circular button on gamepad.<br />
    You have four special attacks, which you can choose by holding a direction while you press the button.<br />
    Special attacks often have the most unique effects.
